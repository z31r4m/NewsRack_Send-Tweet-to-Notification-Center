# NewsRack "Send Tweet to Notification Center" #

Quick, dirty, made in between coffee fixes.

## Why?

Newsrack is dead. RIP. This is a script that lived in the Sharing Settings, that used the "Bird" emoji to make a "Share to Twitter via Notification Center" button in NewsRack's toolbar.

What this DID: Opens Notification Center on Mountain Lion, Invokes the Twitter button, pastes the title & URL of what's open in NewsRack into the Tweet UI.

## Requires

- Mac OS X, why? BECAUSE.
- Notification Center in Mountain Lion (tested) with a Twitter account (enabled).
- NewsRack, dead dead dead. You're not using this.
- If you DID use NR, you'd be pasting this where customer sharing scripts go.
- Instead, fork this for something else, maybe when ReadKit or some other RSS reader gets more configurability/custom sharing options.

## QuickStart

- Download the zip or clone from Github
- Look at code. Pine for Newsrack. Dammit.

### Usage

DURRRRRRRR see above.

### Workarounds

None. This USED to work great.

### Warranties

NONE. Use as thou wilt. Work(ed|s) for me, YMMV.
